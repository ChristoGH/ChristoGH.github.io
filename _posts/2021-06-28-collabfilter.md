I stumbled on the concept of collaborative filter here () and here  but particularly here().  It attracted my interest because I was wrestling with the idea of how to determine the otherwiseness of medical service providers, ie are they doing what the greater community is doing or not are they biased in other words. That is does a service provider have a preference towards a specific treatment or not.  This is the reverse of course of a traditional recommender engine.  Here we know you should be enjoying a, b and c, but you seem to have a particular preference for d too.  Can collaborative filtering expose these biases?
this is doing a provider treatment expose, this can be extended to a member treatment approach or even any other grouping that is captured by the data.
