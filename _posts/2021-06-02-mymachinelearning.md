# This is how it started


My first recollection of 'machine learning' was using a programmable Sharp PC-1401 Pocket Computer in the early 80's.  I tried to 'model' the odds of horse races and 'predict' outcomes.  Of course a very lucrative business!  I wrote my first programs here and had my very first (of many) null results too.  I remember tabulating features  on a Saturday morning, jocky weight and age and previous results and horse age etc and previous results and apply some logic to come to a prediction of sorts. Never made real money but it was fun going down to the betting office with my secrets and placing bets and waiting for the results.  

In bought my firs pc in 1985, with bursary money, an 8086 with an 8087 bmath coprocessor added later.   A 20MB hard disk and 2 360kb floppy drives and a green monochrome screen the size of a small microwave it was my pride and joy.  A dot matrix printer with folded printer paper completed the picture.  No a specialised computer desk on wheels completed the picture, No wait a typist chair completed the picture did that!  At some stage I added a slow and nosy modem and with a phone line installed in my bedroom and then I was at the forfront of technology.   I could fax documents(!) and link up to portal where I had access to share prices. Pretty early on I added Turbo Pascal. with several toolboxes.  And there the adventure started. 

I studied physics, theoretical physics and mathematics.  A theoretical physicist build models of the physical world and an experimental physicist collects data to test models to understand the physical world.  I became an experimental physicist, collecting data and testing models.  Using detectors of radiation, volume of data far exceeded storage or computational ability.
