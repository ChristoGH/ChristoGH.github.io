# About

I will add posts here...  Definitely about my interest in AI and Machine learning and then anything else I feel may be of interest or worth sharing!

I started out my post schooling life in the sciences and mathematics but physics in particular. I later did an MBA and ended up in the financial 
markets.  From here I ended up in quantitative analysis, derivative pricing, interest rate structuring and sales, and ultimately into algorithmic trading.  Can you do experimental science without data?  I think not.  So I would call myself a scientist. With data.

Yours,
Christo Strydom.
