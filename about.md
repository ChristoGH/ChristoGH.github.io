# About

I will add posts here...  More about my interest in AI and Machine learning than any thing else.

I started out in the science and mathematics but physics in particular. I later did an MBA and ended up in the financial markets.  From here I ended up in quantitative analysis, derivative pricing, interest rate structuring and sales and ultimately into algorithmic trading.

Yours,
Christo Strydom.
